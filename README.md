DisneylandHotelPriceSraper
==========================

Created a quick Python script using Beautiful Soup to grab hotel prices for the Disneyland hotel during a set of target dates. Basic idea is to monitor day to day prices and decide whether to pull the trigger on a trip. Very nice when added as a shell script in Automator (application) which then writes the output to a file. Then added that Automator app as a daily event alert in iCal to get everything running without any human interaction.
